    "text": "Reference Paper: Eggers at al. (2019)\nStudy Population:\nThe dataset included 108 kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), consisting of pre-transplant (n = 54) and post-transplant (n = 54) RCC patients. The primary objective was to compare demographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics, as well as survival outcomes between the two patient groups.\nDescriptive Statistics:\nTo describe the baseline characteristics and surgical details, we generated tables reporting mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables and counts (percentages) for categorical variables. These tables were stratified by patient groups (pre- and post-transplant RCC) and analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Pearson’s Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.\nSurvival Analysis:\nWe examined survival times, measured as years from RCC diagnosis to death (or last follow-up for surviving patients), for a subset of patients with available survival data (n = 88). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for pre- and post-transplant groups to illustrate time-to-event distributions visually. Log-rank tests were used to evaluate differences in survival across groups, providing insight into potential variations in prognosis.\nAdditionally, a univariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to assess the hazard of mortality for post-transplant patients compared to pre-transplant patients.\nLimitations:\nThe study’s small sample size (n=108) limits statistical power, which may contribute to non-significant p-values observed in some comparisons between pre- and post-transplant RCC patients. This low power increases the chance of Type II errors, meaning that true differences may not reach statistical significance in this analysis. Future studies with larger cohorts are needed to better assess these potential differences and provide more conclusive evidence.\nSoftware:\nAll analyses were conducted using the R Statistical Language (Version 4.4.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."
