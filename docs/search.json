The primary aim was to compare clinical characteristics, surgical features, and survival outcomes across these groups.\nDescriptive Analysis:\nPatient demographics, surgical details, and outcomes were summarized by median (IQR) for continuous variables and by count (percentage) for categorical variables. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed group differences in continuous variables, while Fisher’s exact test evaluated categorical differences.\nSurvival Analysis:\nFor a subset with available time-to-death or follow-up data (n=87), we analyzed survival from RCC diagnosis to death or last follow-up using Kaplan-Meier curves. Log-rank tests assessed differences in survival distributions between groups, offering insights into potential prognostic variations.\nLimitations:\nThe study’s limited sample size (n=106) reduced statistical power, which may have led to non-significant p-values in certain comparisons, raising the risk of Type II errors. Larger cohort studies are recommended to validate these findings and clarify potential differences in outcomes.\nSoftware:\nAll analyses were conducted using the R Statistical Language (Version 4.4.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."
